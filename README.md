# BreakTimer for Windows

## Installation
1. Download and unzip [BreakTimer/Executables/windows/BreakTimer.zip](https://github.com/SymboLinker/BreakTimer/raw/main/BreakTimer/Executables/windows/BreakTimer.zip).
2. Move the files to a folder of your choice.
3. Create two shortcuts by right clicking `BreakTimer.exe` and selecting `Create shortcut`. Then:
    1. put one shortcut on your desktop.
    2. put one shortcut in `C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` to start BreakTimer automatically when starting up Windows. (If that folder does not exist, find your `Startup` folder via `Windows + R`, `shell:startup`, `OK`.)
4. Double click the shortcut on your desktop to start BreakTimer.

## Notes
- By default the timer is set to 45 minutes, but you can change that.
- The reminder window stays on top of other windows until you click it. (But you can continue to work in other windows - it just stays visible.)
- BreakTimer can start up automatically - see the installation procedure above.
- Even if you use the `Startup` folder, you can shut down BreakTimer easily and anytime you want.
